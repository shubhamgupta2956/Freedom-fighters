        <p>Mahatma Gandhi led the Indian independence movement and was successful in freeing India from the clutches of the British. He employed non-violence and engaged in various movements as part of his inspiring protest against the British rule. He went on to become the most significant freedom fighter and hence is called as the ‘Father of the Nation.’
